        <h2>Dog</h2>
        <p>dog, (Canis lupus familiaris), domestic mammal of the family Canidae (order Carnivora). It is a subspecies of
            the gray wolf (Canis lupus) and is related to foxes and jackals. The dog is one of the two most ubiquitous
            and most popular domestic animals in the world (the cat is the other). For more than 12,000 years it has
            lived with humans as a hunting companion, protector, object of scorn or adoration, and friend.
        </p>
        <p>The dog evolved from the gray wolf into more than 400 distinct breeds. Human beings have played a major role
            in creating dogs that fulfill distinct societal needs. Through the most rudimentary form of genetic
            engineering, dogs were bred to accentuate instincts that were evident from their earliest encounters with
            humans. Although details about the evolution of dogs are uncertain, the first dogs were hunters with keen
            senses of sight and smell. Humans developed these instincts and created new breeds as need or desire arose.
        </p>
        <p>Dogs are regarded differently in different parts of the world. Characteristics of loyalty, friendship,
            protectiveness, and affection have earned dogs an important position in Western society, and in the United
            States and Europe the care and feeding of dogs has become a multibillion-dollar business. Western
            civilization has given the relationship between human and dog great importance, but, in some of the
            developing nations and in many areas of Asia, dogs are not held in the same esteem. In some areas of the
            world, dogs are used as guards or beasts of burden or even for food, whereas in the United States and Europe
            dogs are protected and admired. In ancient Egypt during the days of the pharaohs, dogs were considered to be
            sacred.

    <div id="cat">
        <h2>Cat</h2>
        <p>
            cat, (Felis catus), also called house cat or domestic cat, domesticated member of the family Felidae, order
            Carnivora, and the smallest member of that family. Like all felids, domestic cats are characterized by
            supple low-slung bodies, finely molded heads, long tails that aid in balance, and specialized teeth and
            claws that adapt them admirably to a life of active hunting. Cats possess other features of their wild
            relatives in being basically carnivorous, remarkably agile and powerful, and finely coordinated in movement.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is noteworthy that the ancestors of the other common household pet, the dog, were social animals that
            lived together in packs in which there was subordination to a leader, and the dog has readily transferred
            its allegiance from pack leader to human master. The cat, however, has not yielded as readily to
            subjugation. Consequently, the house cat is able to revert to complete self-reliance more quickly and more
            successfully than most domesticated dogs. For an account of the relationship of the family of cats to other
            carnivores, see carnivore.

    <div id="horse">
        <h2>Horse</h2>
        <p>
            horse, (Equus caballus), a hoofed herbivorous mammal of the family Equidae. It comprises a single species,
            Equus caballus, whose numerous varieties are called breeds. Before the advent of mechanized vehicles, the
            horse was widely used as a draft animal, and riding on horseback was one of the chief means of
            transportation.
        </p>
        <p>
            In prehistoric times the wild horse was probably first hunted for food. Research suggests that domestication
            had taken place by approximately 6,000 years ago. It is supposed that the horse was first used by a tribe of
            Indo-European origin that lived in the steppes north of the chain of mountains adjacent to the Black and
            Caspian seas. Influenced by climate, food, and humans, the horse rapidly acquired its present form.
        </p>
        <p>
            The relationship of the horse to humans has been unique. The horse is a partner and friend. It has plowed
            fields and brought in the harvest, hauled goods and conveyed passengers, followed game and tracked cattle,
            and carried combatants into battle and adventurers to unknown lands. It has provided recreation in the form
            of jousts, tournaments, carousels, and the sport of riding. The influence of the horse is expressed in the
            English language in such terms as chivalry and cavalier, which connote honour, respect, good manners, and
            straightforwardness.

    <div id="cow">
        <h2>Cow</h2>
        <p>
            cow, in common parlance, a domestic bovine, regardless of sex and age, usually of the species Bos taurus. In
            precise usage, the name is given to mature females of several large mammals, including cattle (bovines),
            moose, elephants, sea lions, and whales.
        </p>
        <p>
            Domestic cows are one of the most common farm animals around the world, and the English language has several
            words to describe these animals at various ages. A baby cow is called a calf. A female calf is sometimes
            called a heifer calf and a male a bull calf. A heifer is a female that has not had any offspring. The term
            usually refers to immature females; after giving birth to her first calf, however, a heifer becomes a cow.
            An adult male is known as a bull. Many male cattle are castrated to reduce their aggressive tendencies and
            make them more tractable. Young neutered males, which are primarily raised for beef, are called steers or
            bullocks, whereas adult neutered males, which are usually used for draft purposes, are known as oxen. A
            group of cows, cattle, or kine (an archaic term for more than one cow) constitutes a herd. English lacks a
            gender-neutral singular form, and so “cow” is used for both female individuals and all domestic bovines.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cows are members of the order Artiodactyla. The order contains even-toed hoofed mammals, and cows have
            distinctive cloven hooves (derived from the toenails from the middle two digits of each foot). Cows belong
            to the family Bovidae (hollow-horned ruminants, which also includes antelope, sheep, and goats), subfamily
            Bovinae (which includes buffaloes and spiral-horned antelope), tribe Bovini (which includes cattle, bison,
            and yak), and genus Bos—the names of which are all derived from bos, the Latin word for cow.
